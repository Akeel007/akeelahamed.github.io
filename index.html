                    After my sad realisation at high school that I wouldn’t make it as a pro basketball player for my country (the knee injury didn’t help), I focused my attention on academics (it was O’levels). It dawned on me that the subject I hated most (Math) was beginning to grow on me. 
From then on, through constant practice and hard work, I have developed a deep affinity to this subject and am constantly intrigued by the integration of Mathematics in our daily lives: whether in Economics, Health, Finance , OR, Machine Learning or Data Science, the Math is almost omnipresent.

My Summer School at The London School of Economics in 2015 introduced me to the deeply exciting field of Data Science and I have been hooked onto it ever since. I have undertaken many Data related projects in Python and R using various Machine Learning algorithms, Big Data and Data Visualisation tools.  My Masters at LSE provided me with added exposure to the field in terms of the projects I undertook and the brilliant professors I was fortunate to learn under.

I also have a passion for effective communication (with a lot of Public Speaking Experience) and thus try to integrate simplicity and clarity in all the projects I do.
